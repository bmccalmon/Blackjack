# Blackjack
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value of 21, or as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## Gameplay
In a game of blackjack, the player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt two cards, with one of the dealer's cards being face up and the other face down (the "hole" card). The player can then choose to "hit" and receive additional cards in an attempt to improve their hand, or "stand" and keep their current hand. The player must continue to hit until they choose to stand or their hand value exceeds 21, at which point they lose the game (known as "busting").

After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hole card and hits or stands according to a set of predetermined rules. The dealer must hit if their hand value is less than 17 and stand if their hand value is 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, the player wins the game. If the player and dealer have the same hand value, the game is a tie (known as a "push"). If the player's hand value is greater than the dealer's hand value, the player wins the game.

## My Implementation
I have implemented a console-based version of Blackjack in Java. The visuals can be implemented in different ways by extending the Blackjack class.

The game can be played with a single player against the dealer, or with multiple players taking turns against the dealer. Currently, the game only allows players to hit or stand, but I plan to add additional functionality in the future.
